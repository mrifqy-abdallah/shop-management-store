# About
This is a project that I did during my two-months internship at [ByTechnology](https://www.facebook.com/ByTechnologyIndonesia/) at Sleman, Yogyakarta.  
This project is made using [Serenity](https://serenity.is/), and the web itself is designed as a management system for shops.

## What can it do?
Here's some things that the web can do as a shops-management-system:  
- Managing the record of workers and assigning a role for each one. The roles can be made inside the system and different privileges can be given to each role.
- Authenticate users.
- Managing the record of products.
- Handling purchasement
- And it has a dashboard that gives insights such as the total purchase of today, running out of product(s), etc.
